    Assuming you install React with Bower, you include React,
    then the JSXTransformer which turns JSX into JavaScript
    and then your React code.

    In production, you'll want to not use the JSXTransformer
    and should instead look at using something like Gulp, Grunt or
    WebPack to compile JSX into JavaScript. Also, check out:

    This is where you link to your React code. Can be .js or .jsx
